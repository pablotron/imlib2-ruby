  * added ellipse routines (Imlib2::Image#{draw,fill}_ellipse)
  * added rotation routines (Imlib2::Image#rotate{,!})
  * updated checkerboard.rb to draw pieces as well (to test
    {draw,fill}_ellipse)

* Saturday, March 30 15:07:02 2002 EST 
  * added draw_oval and fill_oval (more concice aliases for *_ellipse)

* Saturday, March 30 20:11:18 2002 EST
  * added Imlib2::Image#draw_text() -- works as follows:
    im.draw_text font, text, [x, y]
    im.draw_text font, text, [x, y], color
    im.draw_text font, text, {'x' => x, 'y' => y}
    im.draw_text font, text, {'x' => x, 'y' => y}, color
    im.draw_text font, text, x, y
    im.draw_text font, text, x, y, color

* Sunday, March 31 06:04:06 2002 EST
  * added Imlib2::Gradient::* (Imlib_Color_Range)
  * added Imlib2::Image#{,fill_}gradient
  * examples/checkerboard.rb now uses a Gradient for the foreground color
  * added Imlib2::ColorRange (inherits from Imlib2::Gradient, so it's
    essentially an alias for Gradient)

* Sunday, March 31 06:46:36 2002 EST
  * added Imlib2::Polygon::*
  * added examples/test_poly.rb
  * renamed examples/checkerboard2.rb to examples/oo-board.rb

  * added Imlib2::Image::blend_image! and Imlib2::Image::blend_image
    (and also their more concise synonyms: blend! and blend, respectively)

  * released 0.3.0

* Sunday, April 14 02:17:11 2002 EST
  * inline documentation (for rdoc) finished for Imlib2::Border,
    Imlib2::Cache, and Imlib2::Color::RgbaColor.

* Sunday, April 14 04:01:55 2002 EST 
  * inline documentation for Imlib2::Color::HsvaColor
  * changed border.{l,l=,r,r=,t,t=,b,b=} to aliases instead of method
    defines

* Wednesday, April 17 15:58:40 2002 EST
  * added Imlib2::Filter and associated methods
  * Imlib2::Image#filter (it's polymorphic; takes either a String,
    which it passes to imlib_apply_filter(), or an Imlib2::Filter,
    which it passes to imlib_image_filter()).  the explicit calls 
    are Imlib2::Image#string_filter and Imlib2::Image#static_filter,
    respectively.

* Wednesday, April 17 16:35:36 2002 EST
  * added support for text directions (via Imlib2::Direction::LEFT,
    Imlib2::Direction::RIGHT, etc).  it's now an optional last argument
    to Imlib2::Image::#draw_text

* Thursday, April 18 14:06:17 2002 EST
  * added Imlib2::ColorModifier
  * added Imlib2::Image#apply_color_modifier and Imlib2::Image#apply_cmod
    they take either a color modifier or a color modifier and a rectangle
  * added Imlib2::Encoding (font encoding constants)
  * initial Imlib2::Context code.

* Thursday, April 18 15:44:57 2002 EST

* Thursday, April 18 20:09:59 2002 EST
  * documentation for Imlib2::Color::HlsaColor methods
  * documentation for Imlib2::Color::CmyaColor methods
  * documentation for Imlib2::Image::load_* methods

* Friday, April 19 00:05:04 2002 EST
  * documentation for all Imlib2::Image methods
  * documentation for all Imlib2::Font methods
  * documentation for all Imlib2::Gradient methods
  * documentation for all Imlib2::Filter methods
  * documentation for all Imlib2::Context methods

* Friday, April 19 01:22:06 2002 EST
  * updated TODO
  * posted docs online (http://www.pablotron.org/software/imlib2-ruby/doc/)
  * updated README to mention doc/ dir
  * copied ChangeLog online
  * released 0.4.0

* Monday, April 22 11:48:33 2002 EST
  * fixed a bug in draw_pixel reported by Phlip (phlip_cpp@yahoo.com).
  * updated Imlib2 requirement in README, and added a link to the source
    download (via Sourceforge FTP).
  * change Imlib2::Context get methods so they don't require an argument
    (oops :D)
  * added workaround for broken imlib_image_draw_pixel() call (uses
    imlib_image_draw_rectangle() instead)
  * released 0.4.1

* Wednesday, April 24 22:00:37 2002 EST
  * removed tutorial/ directory (how the hell did that get in the main
    release?)
  * minor fix to examples/checkerboard.rb (and examples/oo-board.rb) to
    avoid imlib2 fill_ellipse bug

* Sunday, April 28 21:48:36 2002 EST
  * added Imlib2::Image::draw_pixel_workaround{?,=} to enable or disable
    imlib_image_draw_pixel() work-around behavior
  * changed minor number to 5 (0.5.0)
  * added X11 calls
  * partial support for X11 primitives in Imlib2::X11, although I doubt
    they interact properly with Ruby/X11 or Ruby/Xlib properly.
  * TODO: Ruby/Gtk+ support (via gdkx primitive wrappers)
  * changed all instances (except one, where it was appropriate) of
    STR2CSTR() to RSTRING(blah)->ptr.  should be a minor speed increase
    (and, more importantly, it won't leak memory any more)
