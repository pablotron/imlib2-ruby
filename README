Introduction
============
Imlib2-Ruby is a Ruby interface to Imlib2.  Border, Cache, Color, Color
Modifier, Color Range (Gradient), Context, Ellipse, Filter (static and
scripted), Font, Image (all non-X11 calls), Polygon, and TrueType
Encoding calls are all implemented;  X11 calls are not supported yet.
I've provided a my test script and handful of commented scripts in
examples/, and there's an rdoc-generated API reference in doc/ (which
you can rebuild yourself by typing "rdoc ./imlib2.c"). Feel free to
